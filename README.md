This game was a dedeication to my dad. It was the first game I made so it meant alot to him it was ok and if you have copied and pasted the code along with the images and sound you will think that too. He took me to the ABAR 2018 Blockchain and AI confrence and that is what inspired me to code, it was a fun experience learning to code and now I can code in Python, HTML, Javascript and CSS. 

Python is a general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
